Configuring the Operating System and Installing the Required Libraries
To run FlyCapture2 on a Linux Ubuntu system, install the following dependencies:

libraw1394-8
libgtkmm-2.4-dev
libglademm-2.4-dev
libgtkglextmm-x11-dev (libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev in Ubuntu 8.10 and newer)
libusb-1.0 (Ubuntu 9.04 and newer)



To install the FlyCapture2 SDK:

Download FlyCapture2 SDK from the Point Grey Downloads webpage. You will need a downloads account to access the Download links.
Unpack the software in the directory where you want to install it. There are ten packages:
libflycapture-<version>_<platorm>.deb
libflycapture-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
libflycapturegui-<version>_<platorm>.deb
libflycapturegui-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
libflycapture-c-<version>_<platorm>.deb
libflycapture-c-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
libflycapturegui-c-<version>_<platorm>.deb
libflycapturegui-c-<version>_<platorm>-dev.deb
flycap-<version>_<platorm>.deb
flycapture-doc-<version>_<platform>.deb
The packages with a preceding 'lib' are all the shared objects and their respective dev packages.
The flycap package installs the capture application which can be launched by entering 'flycap' in a terminal
or through the applications menu. The flycapture-doc package contains Point Grey documentation in pdf format.

Run the install script in the same directory into which you unpacked the software. 
user$ sudo sh install_flycapture.sh
Follow the instructions of the script. This installs all the FlyCapture2 libraries, example code, sample applications, and documentation.

The script prompts you to configure udev so that devices can be used by a particular user.
If you choose to configure devices, the script changes permissions on the nodes by overwriting the default
Ubuntu permissions and giving the user full read and write access to the device nodes.
Restart your computer for the user permissions to take effect.

Configuring USBFS


By default, Linux limits image capture to 2 MB. 
To capture images over 2 MB, extend the USBFS limit 
on how many buffers can be locked into the driver. 
This is done by updating the boot params in grub.
You can set the memory limit until the next reboot, or set it permanently.

To set the maximum usbfs memory limit until the next reboot, run this command:
$ sudo modprobe usbcore usbfs_memory_mb=1000

%%%%%%%%%%%%    ATTENTION     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This method does not work with Ubuntu 14.04 or newer. 
With Ubuntu 14.04, users must set the memory limit permanently.

To set the maximum usbfs memory limit permanently:
1. Open the /etc/default/grub file in any text editor. 

Find and replace:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

with this:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000"

2. Update grub with these settings:

$ sudo update-grub

3. Reboot and test a USB 3.0 camera.

If this method fails to set the memory limit, run the following command:

$ sudo sh -c 'echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'
To confirm that you have successfully updated the memory limit, run the following command:

cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb
